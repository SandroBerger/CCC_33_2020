# Coding Contest 33 (April 2020)
The input files for all levels can be found under the resouce folder where also the output files get saved to.

## Level 1

Find the minimum and the maximum for each type of value, except for
the altitude where we already know the minimum is 0 (generally, but
the slice of data you see might not have it).
Float values are compared with a maximum allowed error of 10-5

| ------------- |-------------| -----|
| Format      | N <br>timestamp,lat,long,altitude <br>(repeats N times) | minTimestamp maxTimestamp <br>minLat maxLat <br> minLong maxLong <br>maxAltitude |
| Types      | N (int) Number of flight entries that follow <br>timestamp (int) Amount of seconds since a fixed point in time <br>lat (float) North latitude of the coordinate. In degrees <br>long (float) East longitude of the coordinate.

## Level 2
Repeated for each pair of airports, A and B, that have at least one flight
going from A to B. Direction matters
Sort alphabetically by A and then B

* Each entry from the previous level will receive 3 new fields.
* For each entry you now know where the plane is coming from, where itâ€™s
going and when it took off.
* The starting and destination airports are given as strings, denoting their IATA
codes.
* The takeoff time is given as a timestamp.
* Based on this data, for each pair of airports, A and B, count the number of
unique flights that start from A and go to B.
* Output all pairs that have at least one flight, and the number of flights between
them
* Sort them alphabetically by A and then B.
